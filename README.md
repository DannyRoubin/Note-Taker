# Note-Taker

## App Description

This app allows a user to record notes and view them as need be. The user can simply start the app by clicking the start button on the homepage, which will take the user to a set of premade notes to demonstrate functionality of the app. From this page, the user is able to click on the icon in the top right hand corner to create their own note. Upon creation the user is able to see their note on the left hand side of the page alongside all of their other notes. To view their note, the user simply clicks on it and they will be able to view it.

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

My motivation to create this project was to be able to easily record notes from my computer and be able to store them in a spot which is easy to view.

## Problems I came across during development

There weren't too many problems that I came across during the development of this project. The main bug I ran into was being able to run the website from my local machine at the beginning of app production. Although I eventually resolved the issue, it was frustrating to work around until I got it resolved.

## What I learned from this project

From this project, I greatly increased my ability and knowledge of routes and how to use them. Although I am not entirely comfortable with them quite yet, this was a very good introduction assignment to them.

## App usage (for running on your local machine)

To use this app, simply clone this github repo onto your machine. Open the Repo on your machine and type in npm i to install the packages and then afterwards simply run 'npm run watch', next open up http://localhost:3001/ on your browser and follow on screen instructions from there.
